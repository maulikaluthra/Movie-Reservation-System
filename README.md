# Movie-Reservation-System
This is a user friendly program and menu driven program which is designed to book tickets from the movies displayed. Turbo C++ is used for this.
The admin can insert and delete the entries according to the movies being displayed in the movie hall. All the movies are further displayed to the user, with all the details of the selected movie, including the censor rating and duration. The user can then choose the seats of their choice.
